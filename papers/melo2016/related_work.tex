		To discuss:
		\item Look at Manuel Wimmer's paper at MOMO'16 for related work. They have a solution using MOEA and Henshin
		\item QVTR
		\item Crepe
		\item Searching Models, Modeling Search: On the Synergies of SBSE and MDE \cite{Kessentini+13}. General position paper. Focuses on genetic encoding of models 
		      (like Crepe). Proposes a general infrastructure/architecture for MDE search.
		\item \cite{Denil+14} (also a version at https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/files/techReports/icse.pdf) use transformation scheduling specifications to implement 
		      single-state (non-population based) optimisation algorithms directly over models 
		      (using transformations to describe exploration steps). They provide some good arguments for why this is a good approach. I think their approach would be
					difficult to extend to population-based approaches as the current model is somewhat implicit in the scheduling specification. Also, they do not touch on
					what breeding means for models. They provide some performance analysis.
					
					Look at references in \cite{Denil+14}!
					
		\item \cite{Abdeen+14} present an approach similar to MOMOT, but based on Viatra. Have some interesting discussion of repair/ranking of invalid solution
		      candidates.
					
	  \item \cite{BurtonPoulding13} gives a good discussion of why one would want to optimise at the model level. They also introduce the idea of domain-specific
		      encodings (even though they don't call it that).
