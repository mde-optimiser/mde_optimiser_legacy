		To discuss:
		\item Look at Manuel Wimmer's paper at MOMO'16 for related work. They have a solution using MOEA and Henshin
		\item QVTR
		\item Crepe

		\item \cite{Denil+14} use transformation scheduling specifications to implement single-state (non-population based) optimisation algorithms directly over models 
		      (using transformations to describe exploration steps). They provide some good arguments for why this is a good approach. I think their approach would be
					difficult to extend to population-based approaches as the current model is somewhat implicit in the scheduling specification. Also, they do not touch on
					what breeding means for models. They provide some performance analysis.
					
					Look at references in \cite{Denil+14}!
