		\item Search-based and optimisation approaches to design are becoming more important (SBSE), but they are also important to adaptation (cite our cloud work,
					mention robotics). 
		\item The domains concerned can be quite complex, capturing them in traditional optimisation-oriented ways is difficult.
		\item Some earlier work exists that tries to define a generic mechanism of translating models into genome representation (cite Crepe complete paper and
					James' thesis), but this has issues. Discuss these issues in detail here or possibly in its own section below.
		\item Main problem: loses lots of domain-specific knowledge.
		\item We have spent lots of time to design a good meta-model based on extensive domain analysis. Why not use this knowledge when developing optimisations?
		\item In this paper, we propose a technique and prototype tool for doing so and present its application to a simple case study. This forms the basis of a 
					research agenda.
		\item Structure of the paper etc.
