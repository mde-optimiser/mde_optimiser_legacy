	Three ingredients are required for any search-based algorithm: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A representation of individual candidate solutions;
		\item A mechanism for generating new candidate solutions from existing candidate solutions (e.g., through mutation or breeding); and
		\item A mechanism for evaluating the quality of candidate solutions; that is how well they satisfy each of the optimisation objectives (often called the solution's fitness).
	\end{enumerate}
	Most search algorithms also require a means of generating an initial population of candidate solutions. Once these ingredients have been defined for a specific problem, we can apply standard 
	search-based algorithms.
	
	As discussed above, we will use models to represent individual candidate solutions. Therefore, the overall search space is defined by providing a meta-model. An
	initial population of candidate solutions can be provided in a number of ways---for example, it could be provided as a set of explicit model files or we could
	use constraint solvers like Alloy \cite{Jackson02} to generate a suitable set of initial models (e.g., using the Cartier tool originally developed for
	transformation testing \cite{Sen+08,Sen+09}).
	
	To generate new solutions from existing ones, endogenous model transformations are an obvious candidate. In particular, we propose to use graph transformations, as they have a clear and simple
	syntax for easily expressing endogenous transformations. For example, Fig.~\figref{zoo_rule} shows a simple Henshin rule that can be used for the search problem described in the previous section.
	Because these rules are defined on the model level, we will often be able to easily write them in a way that ensures all well-formedness rules are preserved.

	Evaluating the fitness of candidate solutions can take many different forms. In the simplest case, fitness may be determined by a model query---for example expressed in OCL. In other cases, we may
	require to run a simulation of the candidate solution, which may involve further transformations etc. (e.g., \cite{Efstathiou+14,Chatziprimou+14}).
	
	To test out these ideas, we are currently developing a prototype tool for model optimisation.\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/szschaler/mde_optimiser}} Our tool provides a simple Xtext-based
	DSL to allow describing model-based search problems together with an interpreter for running searches. Search algorithms, fitness functions, and initial model provision are modularised behind Java
	interfaces. For search algorithms this means that it is easy to incorporate existing implementations, such as the MOEA framework\footnote{See \url{http://moeaframework.org/}}. We currently have no
	DSL-level support for fitness functions and initial model generation, but plan to add these features. For now, they are specified by providing Java implementations. Solution evolution is realised by
	Henshin transformations.
	
	Figure~\figref{zoo_code} shows an example specification of the \texttt{Zoo} example in our tool. After some configuration information in the first line, this
	code declares the structure of the search space by indicating a meta-model, and then defines relevant fitness functions and model evolvers. Fitness functions are
	currently provided by implementing a specific Java interface; we are planning to provide full OCL integration in the language for simple model queries. Evolvers
	are defined by specifying a Henshin model and naming a unit (often a rule) in this model.

	Figure~\figref{run_code} shows how to run a search using our tool. At this point, we only support programmatic invocation. For this, a new \texttt{Interpreter}
	object needs to be created and configured with a parsed version of the problem, a \texttt{ModelProvider} for generating initial models, and a generic search
	algorithm (a variant of random hill climbing in this example). Invoking \texttt{execute} runs the search as specified and returns the set of solutions found.
