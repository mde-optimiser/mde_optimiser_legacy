\section{Model-based Optimisation}
\label{section:mde_optimisation}

	\begin{draftlist}
		Introduce the mechanism:
		\item Basic concepts: What are the key ingredients of search-based/optimisation-based techniques? Start solution(s), Finding new solutions from existing
					ones, Evaluating solution fitness. On this basis we can generically implement `standard' optimisation algorithms.
		\item Explain what these ingredients can be in an MDE context. Start solutions: Models (discuss different sources for these models); New solutions:
					transformations and merging; Fitness: queries, simulations, \ldots. 
		\item Present the language and tool for expressing this.
