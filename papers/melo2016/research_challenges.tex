	\begin{draftlist}
		Challenges:
		\item Notions of neighbourhoods or directions to allow more existing algorithms to be transferred. Alternatively, find optimisation algorithms that work more
					efficiently with the direct object-structure encoding.
		\item Running/selecting evolvers efficiently, considering pre-conditions.
		\item More compact representations of evolvers, considering that large parts of the model stay constant?
		\item Performance on large systems? Suitable for on-line adaptation?
		\item Languages for expressing different fitness evaluations?
		\item Flexible definition of model providers (mix concerns between needs of algorithm and needs of domain/problem).
		\item \ldots
