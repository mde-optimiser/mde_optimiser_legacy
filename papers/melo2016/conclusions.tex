\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}

  Search-based software engineering (SBSE) and model-driven engineering (MDE) are highly complementary approaches to software engineering. As a result, there has 
	been substantial interest recently in exploring the combination of both approaches, in particular using MDE technologies to simplify and streamline the 
	application of SBSE. This paper adds to the debate by
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Providing an overview and initial classification of the current state of the art;
		\item Identifying issues with generic genetic encodings of models;
		\item Presenting an initial prototype for model-based optimisation; and
		\item Identifying a catalogue of research challenges towards complete support for model-based optimisation.
	\end{enumerate}
